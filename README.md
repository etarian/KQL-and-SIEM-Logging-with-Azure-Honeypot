# KQL-and-SIEM-Logging-with-Azure-Honeypot# üêù Azure Honeypot & Sentinel SIEM Project

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Windows honeypot in Azure, collect and enrich security logs using Microsoft Sentinel, and visualize attacker data using a geolocation map. It's ideal for cybersecurity learning and practice in threat detection, log analysis, and SIEM operations.
